    <h1>A Quick Intoduction</h1>
    <p>Manga is a style of Japanese comic books and graphic novels, typically aimed at both adults and children. The art style and storytelling in manga vary widely, encompassing various genres such as action, romance, science fiction, fantasy, horror, and more. Manga is often serialized in magazines before being compiled into larger volumes known as tank≈çbon. It's a significant aspect of Japanese popular culture and has gained international popularity as well.</p>
    <p>Manga is often times released chapter by chapter on a weekly or monthly basis instead of a full book at once. The books that are printed are volumes that include several chapters. These volumes together makeup the entirety of the story and its multiple plot lines so they have to be read in order. Unlike the anime equivalent of the story there are no fillers in manga. Naruto and Bleach are two popular animes that are notorious for filler episodes. Fillers allow the author to write the next few chapters that need to be animated and for the production team to animate them.  </p>
