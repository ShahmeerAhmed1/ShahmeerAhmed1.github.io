          <h1>Welcome</h1>
          <p>Welcome to the world of Comics, Graphic Novels, and Manga! Komix4U contains information of each of these graphic forms, give suggested readers, and provide reference material to get your research started.</p>
          <p>There is a debate over whether or not graphic novels/comics/manga are real books and "count as reading." Hopefully after reviewing this guide you will be able to see the benefits in how illustrated works can convey just as much meaning and emotion as text-only books.</p>
