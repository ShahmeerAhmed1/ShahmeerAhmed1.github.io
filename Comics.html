    <h1>Comics</h1>
    <p>
        The Encyclopedia Britannica defines comics books as a "bound collection of comic strips, usually in chronological sequence, typically telling a single story or a series of different stories."
    </p>
    <p>The comic book art form consists of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by text and dialogue in the way of text bubbles which is emblematic of the comics art form.</p>
    <p>Comic books are best known to feature superhero and supervillain stories. The top two names, Marvel Comics and DC Comics, have their characters in specific universes where we are lead to believe that all the characters actually live or have lived in the same place and time. This gets a little confusing as there are many renditions of popular characters and their stories change over generations. </p>
    <p>The paper and style of physical comic books have changed over the years. What we now consider "retro comics" were originally done with Ben-Day dots while now we have sleek and shiny paper opposed to the trade paper backs. There is also the name change of how many publishers are choosing to drop the name comics and switch over to "graphic novels" due to the change in appearance and marketing strategies.  </p>
    <h1>Different Types of Comic Books</h1>
    <p>These are a few predominate types of comic book types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Superhero</li>
        <li>Slice-of-Life</li>
        <li>Humor</li>
        <li>Non-fiction</li>
        <li>Science-Fiction/Fantasy</li>
        <li>Horror</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As the gap between graphic novels and comics grows smaller it becomes harder to determine which is which outside of who publishes and what it is directly called on the book.</p>
